0:17|Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup
0:22|Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean
0:26|Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
0:30|Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15
0:35|And so I'll read a book
0:37|Or maybe two or three
0:38|I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
0:43|I'll play guitar and knit
0:46|And cook and basically
0:48|Just wonder when will my life begin?
1:01|Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
1:05|Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
1:10|Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
1:14|Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
1:17|Sew a dress!
1:19|And I'll reread the books
1:21|If I have time to spare
1:23|I'll paint the walls some more
1:26|I'm sure there's room somewhere
1:28|And then I'll brush and brush
1:30|And brush and brush my hair
1:33|Stuck in the same place I've always been
1:37|And I'll keep wanderin' and wanderin'
1:39|And wanderin' and wonderin'
1:42|When will my life begin?
1:48|And tomorrow night
1:51|The lights will appear
1:56|Just like they do on my birthday each year
2:05|What is it like
2:10|Out there where they glow?
2:14|Now that I'm older
2:19|Mother might just
2:21|Let me go
