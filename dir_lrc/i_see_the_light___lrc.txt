0:09|All those days watching from the windows
0:15|All those years outside looking in
0:19|All that time never even knowing
0:24|Just how blind I've been
0:29|Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
0:34|Now I'm here suddenly I see
0:39|Standing here it's all so clear
0:44|I'm where I'm meant to be
0:48|And at last I see the light
0:53|And it's like the fog has lifted
0:57|And at last I see the light
1:01|And it's like the sky is new
1:06|And it's warm and real and bright
1:11|And the world has somehow shifted
1:19|All at once everything looks different
1:24|Now that I see you
1:59|All those days chasing down a daydream
2:05|All those years living in a blur
2:09|All that time never truly seeing
2:13|Things, the way they were
2:18|Now she's here shining in the starlight
2:23|Now she's here suddenly I know
2:27|If she's here it's crystal clear
2:32|I'm where I'm meant to go
2:37|And at last I see the light
2:41|And it's like the fog has lifted
2:46|And at last I see the light
2:50|And it's like the sky is new
2:54|And it's warm and real and bright
2:59|And the world has somehow shifted
3:07|All at once everything is different
3:12|Now that I see you
3:21|Now that I see you
