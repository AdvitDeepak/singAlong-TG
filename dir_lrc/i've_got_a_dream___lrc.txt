0:06|I'm malicious, mean and scary
0:09|My sneer could curdle dairy
0:11|And violence wise, my hands are not the cleanest
0:15|But despite my evil look
0:17|And my temper, and my hook
0:20|I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
0:23|Can't ya see me on the stage performin' Mozart
0:27|Ticklin' the ivories 'til they gleam?
0:30|Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
0:32|For my killer show tune medley
0:36|Thank you
0:37|'Cause way down deep inside
0:38|I've got a dream
0:39|He's got a dream
0:41|He's got a dream
0:43|See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem
0:47|Though I do like breaking femurs
0:48|You can count me with the dreamers
0:50|Like everybody else
0:52|I've got a dream
0:59|I've got scars and lumps and bruises
1:02|Plus something here that oozes
1:03|And let's not even mention my complexion
1:07|But despite my extra toes
1:08|And my goiter, and my nose
1:11|I really wanna make a love connection
1:14|Can't you see me with a special little lady
1:17|Rowing in a rowboat down the stream?
1:21|Though I'm one disgusting blighter
1:23|I'm a lover, not a fighter
1:25|'Cause way down deep inside
1:26|I've got a dream
1:28|I've got a dream (he's got a dream)
1:30|I've got a dream (he's got a dream)
1:31|And I know one day, romance will reign supreme
1:35|Though my face leaves people screaming
1:37|There's a child behind it, dreaming
1:38|Like everybody else
1:40|I've got a dream
1:43|Tor would like to quit and be a florist
1:46|Gunther does interior design
1:50|Ulf is into mime
1:51|Attila's cupcakes are sublime
1:53|Bruiser knits, Killer sews
1:55|Fang does little puppet shows
1:57|And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns
2:12|I have dreams like you, no, really
2:14|Just much less touchy feely
2:16|They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny
2:18|On an island that I own
2:20|Tanned and rested and alone
2:23|Surrounded by enormous piles of money
2:27|I've got a dream (she's got a dream)
2:28|I've got a dream (she's got a dream)
2:30|I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam
2:34|And with every passing hour
2:36|I'm so glad I left my tower
2:38|Like all you lovely folks
2:39|I've got a dream
2:41|She's got a dream (he's got a dream)
2:43|They've got a dream, we've got a dream
2:45|So our differences ain't really that extreme
2:48|We're one big team
2:53|Call us brutal, sick, sadistic
2:55|And grotesquely optimistic
2:57|'Cause way down deep inside
2:58|We've got a dream
2:59|I've got a dream
3:00|I've got a dream
3:00|I've got a dream
3:01|I've got a dream
3:02|I've got a dream
3:03|I've got a dream
3:04|Woo, woo, woo, woo
3:05|Yes, way down deep inside
3:08|I've got a dream
3:15|Yeah
